## General Guidelines

### Healthy Unit Economics
- Gross margin > 50% (minimum)
- Gross margin > 70% (ideal for scalability)
- CAC < 30% of Customer Lifetime Value
- Payback period < 12 months

### Red Flags
- Margin < 30% (very tight, limited room for growth)
- CAC > 50% of LTV (unsustainable)
- Payback period > 24 months (too long)
- Negative unit economics (lose money on each customer)

### Context Matters
- B2B typically has higher CAC but higher LTV
- Consumer products need lower CAC due to lower LTV
- Subscription businesses benefit from LTV over time
- Marketplaces improve economics with network effects
