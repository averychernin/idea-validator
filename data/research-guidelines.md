# Research Quality Guidelines

Standards for web research conducted by Market Fit and Distribution Strategy validators.

## Research Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based
- Every claim must be backed by sources
- Cite URLs for all data points
- Prefer recent data (last 2 years)
- Acknowledge when data is outdated or unavailable

### 2. Multiple Sources
- Minimum 3 sources per major claim
- Cross-reference conflicting information
- Prioritize primary sources over secondary
- Verify data consistency across sources

### 3. Quality Sources
**Tier 1 (Highest Trust)**:
- Company websites (for pricing, features)
- Government data (census, labor statistics)
- Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester, etc.)
- Academic research
- Direct user reviews (G2, Capterra, App Store)

**Tier 2 (Good Trust)**:
- Reputable news outlets
- Industry blogs (established authors)
- Reddit discussions (look for patterns, not single comments)
- Twitter threads from domain experts
- YouTube reviews from known creators

**Tier 3 (Use with Caution)**:
- Anonymous forums
- Quora answers
- Marketing content (may be biased)
- Single-source claims
- Old data (3+ years)

### 4. Transparency
- State confidence level in findings
- Acknowledge data gaps explicitly
- Explain estimation methodologies
- Note when relying on proxies or indirect signals

## Research Methods by Validator

### Market Fit Validator Research

**Competitive Analysis**:
- Search for existing products/services
- Document: pricing, features, positioning
- Find: launch dates, team size, funding (if applicable)
- Review: user feedback, ratings, complaints

**Demand Signals**:
- Reddit search: related subreddits, discussions, pain points
- Google Trends: search volume patterns
- Forum discussions: Stack Overflow, Hacker News, niche forums
- Product launches: Product Hunt, Hacker News Show HN

**Market Sizing**:
- TAM (Total Addressable Market): All potential customers
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): Realistic segment
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): What you could actually reach

Use proxies when direct data unavailable:
- Similar product user bases
- Subreddit member counts
- Search volume estimates
- Adjacent market sizes

**Pricing Analysis**:
- Map competitive pricing tiers
- Identify pricing patterns by segment
- Note: freemium vs paid-only
- Check: what features command premium pricing

### Distribution Strategy Validator Research

**Competitor Acquisition Strategies**:
- Where do they advertise? (LinkedIn, Google, FB)
- Content strategy? (Blog, YouTube, podcast)
- SEO presence? (What keywords rank for)
- Community presence? (Forums, Slack, Discord)
- Partnership/affiliate programs?

**Channel Cost Analysis**:
- Google Ads: CPC for relevant keywords
- Facebook/LinkedIn Ads: CPM/CPC for target audience
- SEO difficulty: Keyword competition analysis
- Content marketing: Time/cost to build audience

**CAC Benchmarks**:
- Industry averages (from industry-benchmarks.md)
- Comparable company CAC (from public data)
- Calculate: Estimated cost per conversion by channel

## Citation Format

Use inline citations:
```
According to G2 reviews, the average rating for [competitor] is 4.2/5 with users citing [specific feedback]. (Source: https://g2.com/...)
```

For estimates:
```
Based on [method], we estimate the market size to be approximately [range]. This is derived from [data source 1], [data source 2], and [assumption]. (Sources: URL1, URL2)
```

For data gaps:
```
Direct data on [metric] is not publicly available. As a proxy, we analyzed [alternative metric] which suggests [finding]. Confidence level: Medium.
```

## Confidence Levels

**High Confidence**:
- Multiple primary sources confirm
- Recent data (last 12 months)
- Direct evidence (not proxy)
- Consistent across sources

**Medium Confidence**:
- 2-3 sources, some indirect
- Data is 1-2 years old
- Uses reasonable proxies
- Some variance between sources

**Low Confidence**:
- Single source or outdated data
- Significant assumptions required
- High variance between sources
- Proxy metrics with loose correlation

**Unknown/Insufficient Data**:
- Cannot find reliable data
- Too many assumptions required
- Mark as NEEDS VALIDATION explicitly
- Provide testing approach for user

## When Research Isn't Enough

Some questions can't be answered through research:
- "Will MY audience specifically want this?"
- "Will THIS positioning resonate?"
- "Is THIS price point acceptable?"

In these cases:
- Mark as NEEDS VALIDATION
- Provide specific testing approach
- Suggest lean validation experiments
- Acknowledge the limitation

## Red Flags to Report

During research, watch for and explicitly report:
- **Graveyard of failed competitors**: Many tried, all failed
- **Negative sentiment**: Consistent complaints about category
- **Saturated market**: 10+ established competitors
- **Declining trends**: Search volume/interest dropping
- **High CAC indicators**: Very expensive keywords, tough competition
- **Regulatory issues**: Legal/compliance barriers mentioned

## Research Time Limits

- **Market Fit Research**: 10-15 minutes (sufficient for directional findings)
- **Distribution Research**: 10-15 minutes (key channels and costs)

This is validation research, not academic research. Goal is directional confidence, not exhaustive analysis.

Agents should follow these guidelines to maintain consistent research quality across all validations.
