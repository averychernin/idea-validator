# Idea Completeness Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that an idea is fully defined before handing off to Market Fit validation.

## Required Information

### ✓ WHAT - Idea Description
- [ ] Clear description of what the product/service is
- [ ] Form factor specified (app, website, physical product, service, etc.)
- [ ] Core functionality defined
- [ ] Scope is manageable (MVP defined) OR user consciously chose full scope

**Red flags:**
- Still vague after 3+ clarifying questions
- User can't articulate what they're building
- Description keeps changing significantly

---

### ✓ WHO - Target Audience
- [ ] Specific target audience identified
- [ ] Goes beyond demographics to include needs/behaviors
- [ ] "First 100 users" can be described
- [ ] Clear why this audience needs the solution

**Red flags:**
- "Everyone" or "anyone" without refinement
- Can't describe characteristics of target users
- Multiple completely different audiences

---

### ✓ WHY - Value Proposition
- [ ] Clear reason why target audience would want this
- [ ] Differentiated from existing alternatives
- [ ] Core value can be stated in one sentence
- [ ] User can articulate the "job to be done"

**Red flags:**
- "Because it's better" without specifics
- Just a feature list, no clear value
- Can't articulate why anyone would switch from current solution

---

### ✓ HOW (Money) - Monetization Model
- [ ] Clear monetization approach (paid, ads, commission, etc.)
- [ ] Specific price point defined
- [ ] Model aligns with target audience and value
- [ ] User has thought through why someone would pay that price

**Red flags:**
- "Free" without monetization plan
- Price point seems arbitrary or poorly thought through
- Monetization model doesn't match audience expectations

---

### ✓ HOW (Much) - Cost Structure
- [ ] User has estimated costs per customer/transaction
- [ ] Major cost drivers identified (hosting, APIs, time, etc.)
- [ ] Unit economics are positive (revenue > costs)
- [ ] Margin is appropriate for industry (check industry-benchmarks.md)

**Red flags:**
- "I don't know" and won't estimate
- "Almost nothing" without thinking through real costs
- Revenue < costs (losing money per customer)
- Margin significantly below industry norms

---

## Overall Completeness Check

### Minimum Viable Definition
Can you answer these questions clearly?
- What is it?
- Who is it for?
- Why would they want it?
- How will you make money?
- What does it cost to deliver?

### Ready for Market Fit Validation?
- [ ] All 5 questions above can be answered clearly
- [ ] Idea definition is stable (not changing with each question)
- [ ] User has confirmed the summary is accurate
- [ ] No major contradictions in their answers
- [ ] Unit economics make sense (or user acknowledges concerns)

### Context Ready for Handoff?
Ensure you can pass to Market Fit validator:
- [ ] Concise idea description (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Specific target audience definition
- [ ] Clear value proposition
- [ ] Pricing and business model
- [ ] Cost structure and margin
- [ ] Industry context (if applicable)
- [ ] Any flags: scope concerns, economics issues, etc.

## When to Proceed Despite Gaps

Sometimes it's okay to proceed with incomplete information:

**Acceptable gaps:**
- Exact cost estimates (rough order of magnitude is enough)
- Specific feature details (core value is clear)
- Complete competitive knowledge (user knows major alternatives)

**Unacceptable gaps:**
- Don't know what they're building
- Can't describe target audience at all
- No idea how to make money
- Zero thought given to costs

## If Checklist Fails

### Too Vague After Multiple Attempts
```
I'm having trouble getting a clear picture of your idea. This might mean it needs more
thinking before validation.

Would you like to:
1. Take some time to think through [specific gaps] and come back
2. Try describing a different idea that's more formed
3. Continue anyway (validation will be less useful)
```

### Contradictory Information
```
I'm seeing some contradictions in what you've described:
- [Contradiction 1]
- [Contradiction 2]

Let's clarify these before moving forward. Which is accurate?
```

### Fundamental Economics Problem
```
Based on what you've shared, the unit economics don't work - you'd lose money on each
customer. We need to address this before validation makes sense.

[Present options: increase price, reduce costs, change model]
```

Use this checklist before every handoff to Market Fit validator to ensure quality and completeness.
